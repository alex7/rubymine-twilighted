# RubyMine-Twilighted

RubyMine-Twilighted is a port from a wellknown TextMate theme - Twilight.

## Installation

### Mac OS X

Copy Twilighted.xml to ~/Library/Preferences/RubyMine10/colors/ and restart RubyMine.

### Windows Vista

Copy Twilighted.xml to C:\Users\%username%\.RubyMine10\config\colors\ and restart RubyMine.

## Warning

This is still an experimental (as much as it could be) Twilight theme port for RubyMine. I'm sure that there are some bits that don't look the best. If you find anything that seriously disturbes your eye, send me an email or DM me at Twitter.

## Authors

Unfortunately I don't know who's the original author of the Twilight theme that's bundled with TextMate. All praise for creating such a nice theme should go to that person.

This modification/conversion of Twilight theme for RubyMine has been created by Martin Kivi from PerfectLine (martin.kivi_at_perfectline_d0t_ee). If you have any comments, suggestions etc, you can follow me on Twitter (<http://www.twitter.com/martinkivi>) or email me directly.
